Explain the entire java life cycle.
There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:
•	Editing the program
•	Compiling the source code
•	Executing the byte code
First, typing & save the program in a text-editor with .java extension.

Second step is compilation. The input to the Java compiler (javac) is Java source code and the output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code which is known as bytecode. The file which is generated after compilation is .class file.

Last step is execution.
The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.

what is class?
A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created
Class defined object data types and methods.
A class is defined by using keyword class followed by the name of class. The body of class is defined inside the curly braces

What is object?
Objects are created from templates known as classes or we can say Object is the reflection of class.
A Java object is a combination of data and procedures working on the available data. The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.  In Java, an object is created using the keyword "new".

What is the entry point of an application?
The main method is the entry point of a Java application.
Specifically、when the Java Virtual Machine is told to run an application by specifying its class (by using the java application launcher), it will look for the main method with the signature of public static void main(String[])before any objects are made

Why main is static?
Without having declared main method static , your program will successfully compile but won't execute and report error at run time. This is necessary since main is called by the Java interpreter before any objects are made. The keyword void simply tells the compiler that main does not return a value.
